# Leetcode

This repo records my leetcode solutions. 

Some problems have more than one solution, usually upper one is more intuitive one.  

## Math

Some problems can be solved with pure math so it is the first section. 
Solutions with math are in most cases simplest and most efficient.  

### Medium problems

[62. Unique Paths](https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/)

## Dynamic Programming

Here is a basic [Introduce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYquumk4nWw).

Dynamic programming problems can be solved with three ways:

1. pure recursive
2. recursive with memory
3. bottom-up
